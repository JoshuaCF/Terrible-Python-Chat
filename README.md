# Terrible-Python-Chat
This is a "chat application" written in Python. I made this as my second attempt at any program that uses networking. My first one was literally "connect, receive message, disconnect". This one maintains a connection and transmits data back and forth. It is terrible, has no error handling, and very little feedback if things go wrong. Don't actually use this.

If you actually want to try this out, do the following:
Have one person open the app and type "host" without the quotation marks.
Have another person open the app and type "join" without the quotation marks.

The second person must then also type the IP address of the host. Make sure there are no extra newlines, by default when you hit enter, chat is cleared except for an extra newline. I don't know why.

Once you've done this, you should have a connection established and any messages sent will appear on the chat logs of both people. Enjoy this awful program.
