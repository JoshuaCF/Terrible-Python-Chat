# Terrible-Python-Chat
This is a chat application written in Python. It's written as a test of what I've learned when it comes to networking and doing any programming involving the internet.

It's genuinely not that great of a chat program, and I have no intentions of making it actually useful. There are already good programs for chat. I want to make it usable, just to see if I can.

The error handling is poor, and little indication is given of anything go wrong, but as of writing this can support live group chats with one person acting as the server and everyone else being clients connected to the server. It uses port 25565 because my friends and I already have opened that port for playing Minecraft, so it's easiest to just use an already open and forwarded port that nothing else should be using.
